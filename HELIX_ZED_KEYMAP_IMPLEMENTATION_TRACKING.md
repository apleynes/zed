# Helix to Zed Keymap Implementation Tracking

This document tracks the implementation status of all Helix keymaps in Zed, following the exact structure and groupings from the [official Helix keymap documentation](https://docs.helix-editor.com/keymap.html).

## Legend

- ‚úÖ **Implemented** - Fully working with tests
- üöß **Partial** - Basic implementation, may need refinement
- ‚ùå **Not Implemented** - Not yet implemented
- üîÑ **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- üìù **Planned** - Planned for implementation

## Normal Mode

Normal mode is the default mode when you launch helix. You can return to it from other modes by pressing the `Escape` key.

### Movement

> NOTE: Unlike Vim, `f`, `F`, `t` and `T` are not confined to the current line.

## Implementation Summary

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented (Core Functionality)
- **Basic Movement**: h, j, k, l, arrow keys
- **Word Movement**: w, e, b, W, E, B with proper punctuation handling
- **Find Character**: f, F, t, T with precise positioning
- **Selection Operations**: 
  - Collapse (`;`), flip (`Alt-;`), merge (`Alt--`, `Alt-_`)
  - Trim (`_`), align (`&`)
  - Copy to next/prev line (`C`, `Alt-C`)
  - Keep/remove primary (`,`, `Alt-,`)
  - Rotate selections (`(`, `)`) and contents (`Alt-(`, `Alt-)`)
- **Regex Selection Operations**:
  - Select regex matches (`s`) with interactive prompt and real-time preview ‚úÖ
  - Split selections on regex (`S`) with interactive prompt and real-time preview ‚úÖ
  - Keep selections matching regex (`K`) with interactive prompt, real-time preview, and exact Helix behavior ‚úÖ
  - Remove selections matching regex (`Alt-K`) with interactive prompt, real-time preview, and exact Helix behavior ‚úÖ
  - **Interactive UI Features**:
    - Real-time preview updates as user types regex pattern ‚úÖ
    - Enter key confirms selection and closes modal ‚úÖ
    - Escape key cancels operation and restores original selections ‚úÖ
    - Graceful handling of invalid regex patterns ‚úÖ
    - Empty pattern handling ‚úÖ
    - Comprehensive UI integration tests ‚úÖ
- **Mode System**: Normal and Select modes with proper switching
- **Line Selection**: x for line selection
- **Basic Editing**: Insert modes, undo/redo, yank/paste, delete/change
- **Window Management**: Basic window operations via Ctrl-w

### üöß Partially Implemented
- **Select All**: % command implemented

### ‚ùå Major Missing Features
- **Minor Mode Systems**: g (goto), m (match), z (view), Space modes
- **Text Objects**: mi, ma commands for inside/around objects
- **Advanced Selection**: Syntax tree operations, shell pipe operations
- **Search Integration**: *, Alt-* for selection-based search
- **Case Operations**: ~, `, Alt-` for case changes
- **Advanced Editing**: R (replace with yanked), Alt-d/Alt-c (no-yank operations)
- **History Navigation**: Alt-u, Alt-U for history
- **Line Operations**: J (join), X/Alt-x (line bounds)
- **Repeat Operations**: Alt-. for motion repeat
- **Register Operations**: Ctrl-r in insert mode
- **Advanced Window**: Window swapping (H, J, K, L)

### üìù Next Priority Implementation Order

1. **Text Objects and Match Mode** (`mi`, `ma`, `mm`)
2. **Goto Mode** (`g` prefix commands)
3. **Case Operations** (`~`, `` ` ``, `` Alt-` ``)
4. **Advanced Selection Operations** (syntax tree, shell pipe)
5. **Space Mode** (file pickers, LSP operations)
6. **View Mode** (`z` prefix commands)
7. **Search Integration** (`*`, `Alt-*`)
8. **Advanced Editing Operations**

### Test Coverage Status

- ‚úÖ **Movement Tests**: 8+ tests covering all basic and word movements
- ‚úÖ **Selection Tests**: 31+ tests covering all selection operations
- ‚úÖ **Integration Tests**: Keystroke simulation and workflow tests
- ‚ùå **Minor Mode Tests**: Not yet implemented
- ‚ùå **Text Object Tests**: Not yet implemented

## Notes

- **Vim Infrastructure Reuse**: Many basic operations leverage existing vim infrastructure in Zed
- **Helix-Specific Implementation**: Word movements, find characters, and selection operations have full Helix-specific implementations
- **Primary Selection Tracking**: Implemented global primary selection index tracking for rotate operations
- **Mode System**: Proper Helix Normal/Select mode distinction implemented
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite for implemented features
- **Manual Verification**: All implemented features verified to work correctly in practice

This tracking document will be updated as new features are implemented. 

### üîß **Recent Fixes Applied**
- **Fixed Interactive Prompts**: Enter/Escape keys now work correctly to confirm/cancel regex dialogs
- **Fixed Keep/Remove Behavior**: Now uses partial matches within selections (e.g., keep "o" on selections "one", "two", "three" keeps "one" and "two")
- **Fixed Key Context**: Updated from "InteractiveRegexPrompt" to "RegexPrompt" to match keymap
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Added helpful regex tips in the prompt dialog
